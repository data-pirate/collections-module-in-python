# The defaultdict is a subclass of Pythonâ€™s dict that accepts a default_factory as its primary argument.
# The default_factory is usually a Python type, such as int or list, but you can also use a function or a lambda too.

sentence = "The world is filled with nice people if you can't find one Be one"
words = sentence.split(' ')
d = defaultdict(int)

for each in words:
    d[each] += 1
